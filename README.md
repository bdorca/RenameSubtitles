# RenameSubtitles
These 2 scripts can be useful when renaming .srt files to match name with episodes.
The subtitles and episodes must be in seprated folders. The number of files in the two directories must be equal.
file_rename.py requires -e (episodes) and -s (subtitles) arguments and can be used to rename individual seasons.
rename_json.py requires -f, a .json file that contains a list a directories (see dirs2.json), it can be used to rename more than one seasons at once.
